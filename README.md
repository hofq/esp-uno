To Access the diffrent Tiny-Projects you can access The Branches at the Top named after the projects.

The Source Code is located in `./src`, the other Folders are related to Platform.IO, an IDE Intigrated in VSCode.

Sometimes you can find a File named `diagram.json` in the Folder. To Test/Run the Setup on [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) you can import that File.

The File "Wokwi.txt" is outdated most of the Time, so you can ignore it.
